About program
The program takes three inputs: the number of nodes in the system, the node that detected the failure first, and the faulty node. Then it simulates the election process to select a new coordinator.

The find_coordinator() function is responsible for sending ELECTION messages to all the nodes with a higher ID than the current node. If any of the higher nodes respond with an OK message, the current node cancels the election process and waits for the higher node to become the coordinator.

If no higher node responds, the current node declares itself as the coordinator and sends a COORDINATOR message to all the lower nodes.

The bully() function initiates the election process and calls the find_coordinator() function. Once the new coordinator is selected, the function prints the result and sends a message to inform all the lower nodes about the new coordinator.

About code
The program simulates the Bully Election Algorithm in a network of three nodes. The user is prompted to input the number of nodes, the index of the faulty node, and the index of the node that detects the failure first.

In the given scenario, there are three nodes, and Node 2 is the faulty node that has failed. Node 1 detects the failure first and initiates the election process.

Node 1 sends an election message to nodes 2 and 3, and both nodes respond with an OK message, indicating that they are still active. Since Node 3 has a higher priority than Node 2, it sends its own election message to Node 2, which does not respond since it has already failed. Thus, Node 3 declares itself as the new coordinator and sends a message to inform nodes 1 and 2 of its election.

The output shows the messages sent and received during the election process, and the final result of the election, which declares Node 3 as the new coordinator.

'''
About 
this program simulates the Raymond tree-based method for mutual exclusion in distributed computing. The program uses an adjacency matrix to represent the spanning tree and implements the find_parent() function to find the parent node of a process. It also maintains request queues and holder variables to keep track of which processes are requesting the token and which process is holding the token, respectively. Finally, the program implements the logic to transfer the token from the parent node to the requesting child node and to release the critical section after the process completes its task.

ip/op:
The program simulates the Raymond tree-based mutual exclusion algorithm in distributed computing. The algorithm ensures that only one process at a time can execute a critical section by maintaining a logical tree structure and a token.

The input to the program is the process ID (0-4) of the process that wants to enter the critical section. The program then prints the adjacency matrix for the logical tree. The tree has a root process with ID 0 and two child processes, 1 and 2, which are connected to process 0, and two child processes, 3 and 4, which are connected to process 1.

The program then finds the parent of the process that wants to enter the critical section by sending a request to the parent process until it reaches the root node, which has the token. The request is stored in the request queue of each node it passes through, and the program prints the request queue at each step.

Once the process finds the parent with the token, it enters a loop where it waits for the token. The parent process sends the token to the requesting child process and updates its holder variable to point to the child. The program prints the request queue and the process that receives the token. This process then becomes the new parent and enters the loop again to wait for the token.

When the process that originally requested the critical section receives the token, it enters the critical section, and the program prints a message indicating this. The request queue for this process is then emptied, and the program prints the new request queue.

If the request queue for the process that holds the token is empty, it releases the critical section, and the program prints a message indicating this. The holder variable for this process is then set to point to itself.

Finally, the program prints the final holder variable, which indicates which process currently holds the token.

At the beginning of the algorithm, the available resources are [3, 3, 2]. The allocated matrix shows how many resources each process is currently holding. The max matrix shows the maximum number of resources each process will need to complete its execution, and the need matrix shows the difference between the maximum resources needed and the currently allocated resources.

The algorithm then attempts to allocate resources to each process in turn. First, P2 is able to allocate its needed resources and execute, leaving the available resources at [5, 3, 2]. The allocated matrix is updated to reflect the new state.

Next, P4 is able to allocate its needed resources and execute, leaving the available resources at [7, 4, 3]. Again, the allocated matrix is updated.

The process continues with P1 and P3 being allocated resources and executing, until finally, P5 is able to allocate its needed resources and execute. At this point, all processes have executed and the system is in a safe state without any risk of a deadlock occurring.

The safe sequence is the order in which the processes executed without causing a deadlock, which is P2 P4 P1 P3 P5 in this case

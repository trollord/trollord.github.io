# 4 The following table shows the number of units of different products sold on different days:

bread_sales <- c(12, 3, 5, 11, 9)
milk_sales <- c(21, 27, 18, 20, 15)
cola_cans_sales <- c(10, 1, 33, 6, 12)
chocolate_bars_sales <- c(6, 7, 4, 13, 12)
detergent_sales <- c(5, 8, 12, 20, 23)

# Create a vector of days
days <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Visualize the data using bar plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))  # Arrange the plots in a 2x3 grid

# Bread sales
